A collective of best practices, tips, tricks and suggestions to make your AI projects run more smoothly.

Go check out the [wiki](https://github.com/MMAI2020/BestPractices/wiki).

If you're here to contribute to the wiki, check with others before adding a section as to not step on each other's toes. Maybe we can use a project to tag what is being worked on.
